1. Wiring
1-1. Solder jumper wires with the switch.
1-2. Connect the wires with GPIO pin 5 & 6. Please refer this site for Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pinout.
Momentary shorting pin 5 and 6 make Raspberry Pi booting up from halt state. 
Also, pin 5 will be used for detecting shutdown and reboot signals from the switch.


2. Test wiring
2-1. First, supply power to Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
2-2. Then, shut it down. After the activity LED (green LED) goes off, Raspberry Pi is in halt state.

sudo shutdown -h now

2-3. Push the switch to test it. Raspberry Pi should boot up. If not, check the continuity of the switch with multimeter.


3. Script for shutdown and reboot
3-1. Create a python script file of any name or location.

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/power-switch.py

3-2. Write a code to detect shutdown and reboot signal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import threading, subprocess
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
def shutdown():
    subprocess.call('sudo shutdown -h now', shell=True)
def edge_detected(pin):
    if GPIO.input(pin):
        t.cancel()
        subprocess.call('sudo reboot', shell=True)
    else:
        t.start()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
        GPIO.setup(5, GPIO.IN)
        GPIO.add_event_detect(5, GPIO.BOTH, callback=edge_detected, bouncetime=10)
        t = threading.Timer(3.0, shutdown)
        while True:
            pass
    finally:
        GPIO.cleanup()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pushing and holding the switch more than 3 seconds makes Raspberry Pi shutdown, 
and pushing the switch less than 3 seconds makes it reboot.


4. Enable script at boot
4-1. Open /etc/rc.local.

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

4-2. Add a line above “exit 0” to execute the script at boot.

python /usr/local/bin/power-switch.py &

4-3. Reboot.

sudo reboot


5. Verify
5-1. Verify reboot by pushing the switch less than 3 seconds when Raspberry Pi is running.
5-2. Verify shutdown by pushing and hold the switch more than 3 seconds when Raspberry Pi is running.
5-3. Verify booting up by pushing the switch when Raspberry Pi is in halt state.
